# TicTacToe-KATA

This KATA solution contains code and test cases to simulate 3*3 TicTacToe game.
Following scenarios have been handled:
1. X always starts the game.
2. X and O play alternately.
3. Each move must be at a different position on the board.
4. X or O wins if row,column or diagonal of Xs/Os are completed.
5. If all positions are occupied on board and neither win it is a drawn game.
6. If any position is empty on board, game is still in progress.
